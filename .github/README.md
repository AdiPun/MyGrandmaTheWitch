## Hello!

My Grandma the Witch is a platformer game I developed using [SumoDigital's Playbuffer](https://github.com/sumo-digital-academy/playbuffer), a single-header C++ library for making simple 2D games.

### The game and using Playbuffer

This game was super fun to make. Using Sumodigital's header and tutorial taught me various essential concepts in game development using C++. Throughout the development process, I learned how to:

- Control the camera's position
- Use a 1D array to map out a tile-based platformer robustly
- Use AABB collision detection with velocity to create an AABB that predicts where the object will be in the next frame
- Implement platformer quality-of-life controls such as coyote-jumping and jump buffering

### Gameplay

- My Grandma the Witch is a platformer game with collect-a-thon elements, find your axe at the top left of the map and press L to smash these cute slimes up. Collect their drops and return to your grandma.
